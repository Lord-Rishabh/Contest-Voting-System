**Contest Voting System**
**• Current System**: In the past, contest voting has often relied on paper ballots to collect votes. However, this way of voting has problems. People might make mistakes, count wrong, or find it hard to count the votes properly. Also, some voting systems need one person or group to control everything, which can make people worry about how fair and open the process is. People might find it hard to join in, worry about someone cheating, or not believe that the vote is fair.
**• Solution**: Using blockchain technology to create a voting system for contests that isn't controlled by one central authority can solve these problems. Smart contracts, which are like digital contracts that automatically enforce the rules, can help make sure the voting is fair and can't be changed after it's done. This makes everyone involved feel like the process is fair and trustworthy.

**How it works:**
**• Smart Contracts for Contest Management:** Smart contracts are deployed on the blockchain to manage various aspects of the contest, including participant registration, submission deadlines, voting periods, and result calculation.
**• Transparent and Immutable Voting Records:** Each vote cast by participants is recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and immutable ledger of voting records. This makes it impossible for someone to tamper or manipulate the votes.
**• Decentralized System for Agreement:** To make sure the voting is fair and safe, the system uses a way of agreeing called a consensus mechanism. This might be Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Authority (PoA), where certain people confirm that the votes are real and fair.
**• Participant Authentication:** People taking part in the voting are checked using special codes called cryptographic keys, which proves they're allowed to vote. This helps prevent identity fraud and ensures the integrity of the voting process.

**Benefits:**
**• Transparency:** The use of blockchain technology ensures transparency in the contest voting process, as all transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be checked by anyone.
**• Security:** The decentralised nature of the blockchain and the use of cryptographic techniques ensure the security and integrity of the voting process, reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation of votes.
**• Dependability:** Participants can trust the voting outcome without relying on a central authority, as the process is governed by smart contracts and agreement methods that are transparent and verifiable.
